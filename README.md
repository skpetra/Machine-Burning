### Machine-Burning
_machine learning with a twist_

# Microsoft malware classification
This is a team project for Machine learning course on PMF, Zagreb. Team members are: _Stanišić Matea, Škrabo Petra, Terzanović Mateja, Tolja Margarita_.

Idea for project come from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/overview). The main goal is to classify malware (using given .byte and .asm files) into one of the 9 families of malware: 
* Ramnit
* Lollipop
* Kelihos_ver3
* Vundo
* Simba
* Tracur
* Kelihos_ver1
* Obfuscator.ACY
* Gatak

We helped ourselfs extracting the features from .byte and .asm files with [this article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283986464_Novel_Feature_Extraction_Selection_and_Fusion_for_Effective_Malware_Family_Classification), using their slightly modified [code](https://github.com/ManSoSec/Microsoft-Malware-Challenge).

We are currently in developing phase - so, all our documentation in making you can track on [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sthznnbrfbym).
